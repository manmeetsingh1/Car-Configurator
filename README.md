# Car Configurator
The _**Car Configurator**_ app is a web application that allows users to customize their car given certain choices (body type, number of doors, exterior/interior color, and wheel size). Their are certain natural constraints to the configuration (i.e. a coupe must have 2 doors, etc.) that are implemented in the application.
